what is component

It is building blocks of specific functionality like Header, Footer, search, abover us, login, sign up

by default there are 4 files in a component

html file => to write html code
css => for style
spec.ts => to write testing logic
.ts => to write component related logic.

ng g c my_cmp => 
after executing this cmd 4 files generated and modified 1 file app.module.ts
app.module.ts   => here components gets registered.


How to use component

import { Component } from '@angular/core';

@Component({
  selector: 'app-header',      // use this tag in html file <app-header></app-header>  we can change this name
  templateUrl: './header.component.html',
  styleUrl: './header.component.css'
})
export class HeaderComponent {

}
==========================================================

Inline style Inline template:

ng g c user-list --inline-style => 
Here we can write styling code in styles arrays which is created in .ts file.
THis command generates three files html spec and ts (No css file created in this cmp)
If there will be very less styling then we can use this approach. 


ng g c user-list --inline-template => 
here also 3 files gets generated. (no html file created.)
we can write html related code in .ts file under template object in .ts file

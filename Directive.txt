@Directive({
  selector: '[appRedE1]'
})
export class RedE1Directive {

  constructor(e1: ElementRef) {
    e1.nativeElement.style.color="red"
   }

}



now use this ta appRedE1 to make element red as follows

In app.component.html file

<h1 appRedE1>Hello world</h1> // text is displyed in red in UI.



// we can change any property of element using directive. here we have changed its style i.e color

File structure in angular

application to test the application to build the aplication like this.
in dependancies json object angular versions are mentioned and version of every library we are using.

In devdependancy json object angular version of all the library required for dev are metnioned.

package-lock.json:

This files has information like
version of all the required dependancies.
i.e suppose package.json file include version of "@angular/cli": "^17.0.3"
than package-lock.json file stores version of all the libraries which @angular/cli uses.
It stores internal dependancies of all packages.

It has actuall dependancies present in this folder.

src folder
app:
This is a component

Index.html:
First file which load in application

main.ts:
It loads the index.html, it bootstraps/loads the angular appliation.

angular.json:
configuaration related to application.
like which html file should load at first. by default it is index.html
which js file should load at first.by default it is main.ts

=======================================================================================================================

What is interpolation:

To disply dynamic data/properties/funcations in html file from .ts file.
My Title is {{title}}  => the title variable is present in .ts file. 

In html file:
<h1> {{getName()}}</h1>

in .ts file
getName()
  {
    return "This is my name";
  }

Above code works


<h1> {{2+2}}</h1>   // output is 4  it works like javascript code. we can write loops and all.

what we cannot do with interpolation:
typoOf() function doesnt work.
increment decrement and assignment operation wont work, 
cannot use new keyword

=================================================================================
